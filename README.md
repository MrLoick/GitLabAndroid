Please see the [issues](https://github.com/Commit451/GitLabAndroid/issues) section to
report any bugs or feature requests and to see the list of known issues.

## Building
The app uses Fabric for Crashlytics, so you will need to generate your own Crashlytics/Fabric key. All in all, your gradle.properties will look something like this:
```Gradle
GITLAB_FABRIC_KEY = FABRIC_KEY_GOES_HERE_BUT_ONLY_REALLY_NEEDED_FOR_RELEASE_BUILDS
```
